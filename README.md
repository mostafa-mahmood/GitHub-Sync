# GitHub-Sync (ghs)
GitHub-Sync (or ghs for short) is a CLI tool designed to fix your GitHub contribution graph.     
Ever coded for hours daily 🧑🏻‍💻, only to push your changes days later and have GitHub count it as a single contribution like you only worked that one day?   

Well, that's why I made this tool! It tracks your local coding activity and syncs it 🔗 with GitHub at regular intervals.    

## Why Use GitHub-Sync?   
You might be wondering, "Aren’t there already tools that can turn my GitHub contribution graph green without me even coding?" Well, yes, there are. But here’s the thing: GitHub-Sync isn’t about gaming the system.   

The purpose of GitHub-Sync is to accurately reflect your actual coding activity on your GitHub contribution graph. It’s not just turning your graph green for the sake of it:   

- **Fixes Your Contribution Graph:** Make it actually represent your work! 🌱
- **Tracks Coding Time:** Know exactly how much time you’ve spent coding. ⏳
- **Automates Commits:** Automatically commit and push your progress at set intervals. 🤖

---

## How It Works 🛠️
- **Detects Your Editor:** Detects when your code editor is open (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, etc.).
- **Tracks Coding Time:** It tracks how long you’ve been coding and commits your progress at regular intervals.
- **Creates Special Repo:** Creates a repo called Activities where the logs are being pushed.
- **Syncs with GitHub:** Your contributions are automatically pushed to GitHub, so your graph stays green. 🌱

## What Does It Commit? 📝
GitHub-Sync commits detailed logs of your coding activity, it appends it to log.txt and Each commit message includes:

- **Work Session**: Total hours spent coding during the session.

- **Activity**: A description of what you’re working on.

- **Editor Used**: The code editor detected during the session (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim).

- **Date and Time**: The exact date and time of the commit.

```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mostafa-mahmood/GitHub-Sync.git
   cd GitHub-Sync
```
Make the Script Executable
```sh
   chmod +x install_linux.sh
```
Run the installation script:
```sh
   ./install_linux.sh
```
**Shell-Specific Instructions**
If you’re not using Bash (e.g., Zsh, Fish), you may need to manually add the installation directory to your `PATH`
